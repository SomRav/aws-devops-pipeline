# 🎯 AWS DevOps Project - Deployment Instructions

## Current Status: ✅ Ready for Deployment

Your project is now fully configured and ready! Here's your complete deployment guide:

## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### ✅ COMPLETED:
1. **Project Setup** - All files configured ✅
2. **Terraform Configuration** - terraform.tfvars filled ✅  
3. **Application Tests** - All passing ✅
4. **Infrastructure Validation** - Terraform plan successful ✅

### 🚀 CURRENT: Infrastructure Deployment
Your AWS infrastructure is currently being deployed via Terraform.

### 📝 NEXT STEPS:

#### 1. Wait for Terraform Completion
- Monitor the terminal for "Apply complete!" message
- Note down the output values (ECR URL, Pipeline URL, etc.)

#### 2. Set Up GitHub Repository Secrets
```bash
# Go to: https://github.com/SomRav/aws-devops-pipeline/settings/secrets/actions
# Add these secrets:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "your-aws-access-key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "your-aws-secret-access-key"  
GITHUB_TOKEN = "your-github-token"
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E..."
PROJECT_NAME = "devops-pipeline"
ALLOWED_IP_RANGE = "0.0.0.0/0"
ECR_REPOSITORY = "devops-pipeline-app"  # From Terraform output
```

#### 3. Push Code to GitHub
```bash
# Run this from your project directory:
bash git-setup.sh
```

#### 4. Monitor GitHub Actions
- Go to: https://github.com/SomRav/aws-devops-pipeline/actions
- Watch the CI/CD pipeline execute:
  - Security scans (tfsec, Trivy)
  - Terraform tests  
  - Application tests
  - Infrastructure deployment

#### 5. Access Your Deployed Application
After deployment completes, you'll have:
- **CodePipeline**: Monitor at AWS Console → CodePipeline
- **Application**: Running on EC2 instance (IP from Terraform output)
- **ECR Repository**: Container images stored here
- **S3 Bucket**: Pipeline artifacts stored here

## 🔍 What's Being Created:

### AWS Infrastructure:
- **VPC** with public/private subnets
- **EC2 instance** (t3.micro) for application hosting  
- **CodePipeline** with 3 stages (Source → Build → Deploy)
- **CodeBuild** project for building/testing
- **CodeDeploy** for application deployment
- **ECR repository** for Docker images
- **S3 bucket** for pipeline artifacts
- **IAM roles** with least-privilege permissions
- **Security groups** with controlled access

### DevSecOps Features:
- **GitHub Actions workflow** for CI/CD
- **Security scanning**: tfsec (Terraform) + Trivy (containers)
- **Automated testing**: Unit tests + Infrastructure tests
- **Kubernetes ready**: Deployment configs + Sealed Secrets
- **Monitoring ready**: Health checks + logging

## 📊 Success Indicators:

### ✅ Terraform Success:
```
Apply complete! Resources: 26 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:
pipeline_url = "https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/..."
application_url = "http://xx.xx.xx.xx:3000"
ecr_repository_url = "905020613657.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/devops-pipeline-app"
```

### ✅ GitHub Actions Success:
- All workflow steps show green checkmarks
- Security scans complete without critical issues  
- Tests pass successfully
- Deployment completes successfully

### ✅ Application Success:
- Visit application URL: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3000`
- Should see: "Hello from AWS DevOps Pipeline!"
- Health check works: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3000/health`

## 🎓 Project Features Demonstrated:

### Task 1: CodePipeline using Terraform ✅
- ✅ AWS CodePipeline with Source/Build/Deploy stages
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- ✅ Terratest for infrastructure validation
- ✅ Complete AWS resource provisioning

### Task 2: DevSecOps Integration ✅  
- ✅ GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- ✅ Security scanning (tfsec + Trivy)
- ✅ Kubernetes Sealed Secrets implementation
- ✅ End-to-end automated deployment

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### If Terraform Fails:
1. Check AWS credentials: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
2. Verify region availability: Some regions may have capacity issues
3. Check GitHub token permissions: Must have `repo` access

### If GitHub Actions Fail:
1. Verify all repository secrets are set correctly
2. Check AWS credentials in secrets
3. Ensure GitHub token has workflow permissions

### If Application Doesn't Start:
1. Check EC2 instance status in AWS Console
2. Verify security group allows port 3000
3. Check CodeDeploy deployment logs

## 📞 Support:
- Check AWS CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
- Review GitHub Actions logs for workflow issues  
- Use AWS CLI to debug resource issues: `aws ec2 describe-instances`
